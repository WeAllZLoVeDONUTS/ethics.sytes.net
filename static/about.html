          <h1 class="page-title">About Ethics</h1>
          <p>By definition, Ethics can be described as the discussion or study of what is morally good or bad. The main argument goes over how much is too much, how much are we wiling to sacrafice to achieve the best possible result for everyone involved. </p>
          <p>According to the official website for the Ethics Bowl, nhseb.unc.edu, "NHSEBâ€™s goal is to do more than teach students how to think through ethical issues: It is to teach students how to think through ethical issues together, as fellow citizens in a complex moral and political community."</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am a student in high school competing in the Ethics Bowl 2020. Unfortunately it will be online due to COVID, so I am not able to experience my first Bowl in person, but this competition would still be a great experience to have was my thought. I am a Junior and love to play video games. I also plan to code in the future, which is the main reason why I am coding this website.</p>
